# CSE 218: Numerical Methods

Welcome to the repository for CSE 218: Numerical Methods. This README provides instructions on how to run the project on VS Code and details about each offline and online assignment.

## Getting Started with VS Code

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Open Workspace Settings**: Open the `.vscode/settings.json` file in VS Code.

3. **Configure Source Paths**: Modify the `java.project.sourcePaths` in the `settings.json` file to point to the parent directory of the main class for the desired problem. For example, for `offline-1/solution-1`, set it accordingly.

4. **Run the Main Class**: Run the main class of the desired problem directly from VS Code.
